### 💮 Introduction 💮
Following events in recent years, calls for transparency and accountability in policing have grown. Body-Worn Cameras (BWCs) were introduced as a tool not only to improve accountability and transparency of police conduct, but also to allow researchers to examine police-citizen interaction. These recordings capture both police conduct and citizen responses, providing insights into what prompts cooperation, non-compliance, resistance or escalation during encounters. 

A central topic in this discussion is police legitimacy – the perception that the police act fairly and justly. Research consistently evidenced that legitimacy reinforces citizen cooperation, yet the question remains: what establishes legitimacy in practice? A large body of literature has found procedural justice – defined by participation, fairness, respectfulness and trustworthy motives – as crucial to building legitimacy and encouraging citizen cooperation. This study explores how procedural justice, maladaptive behaviours, and procedural adherence influence citizen behaviour in real-world situations.

### 🔎 Methodology 🔎
Nine BWC clips, sourced from Lancashire Constabulary, were observed using a secure, access-controlled laptop. These videos depicted real police-citizen interactions of Stop and Search (SaS) and Use of Force (UoF) cases. Videos were systematically coded using an adapted coding framework based on existing studies, supplemented with an additional procedural adherence category using College of Policing guidelines of SaS and UoF. Officer behaviours were categorised as: procedural justice behaviours, maladaptive behaviours and procedural adherence, and citizen behaviours were categorised as: cooperative, resistant, non-compliant, escalatory behaviours, and de-escalatory behaviours. A first-order Markov Chain analysis was conducted to examine sequential patterns of officer conduct and citizen responses to identify what behaviours influence cooperation, non-compliance, or resistance.

### 📊 Results 📊
The results revealed three major findings:  

✨**Procedural Justice**  
- Citizen cooperation was more likely to follow procedural justice behaviours than resistant or non-compliant responses.
- These results provide support for previous evidence that procedural justice strengthens legitimacy and cooperation.

🌩️**Maladaptive Behaviours**
- Maladaptive officer conduct was associated with higher transitions to citizen resistance than to citizen non-compliance.   
- However, transitions from maladaptive officer behaviours were just as likely to result in cooperation as resistance. This suggest that some cooperation may be due to fear or intimidation rather than genuine legitimacy.

☁️**Procedural Adherence**
- Procedural adherence found a higher likelihood of leading to cooperative citizen outcomes than non-compliance.
- However, transitions into resistant outcomes were higher. This suggest that citizens may not recognise whether the official procedures are being followed, but they may respond to whether the interaction feels fair or respectful.

### 🔮 Implications 🔮
These results have several implications for policing practice and training. They reinforce the importance of training, particularly early use of procedural justice behaviours which were shown to be most effective in fostering legitimacy and preventing escalation. Training should emphasise communication strategies that reflect respect, fairness and trustworthiness. Additionally, adhering to official procedures is vital, but it does not guarantee legitimacy on its own. Therefore, police training programmes should integrate and encourage further use of procedural justice alongside procedural adherence – ensuring officers follow procedures but deliver them in ways perceived as fair and respectful. Finally, the study shows that BWCs are a valuable tool for exploring real-world dynamics in police-citizen interactions. Even subtle maladaptive behaviours can escalate resistance or produce cooperation through fear. BWCs are a valuable tool for feedback and scenario-based learning to help officers identify and avoid these behaviours which may affect legitimacy. These tools can help in informing evidence-based training through recognising patterns of behaviours linked to escalatory citizen behaviours or cooperation, improving policing practice. 

This study demonstrated the value of BWCs and sequential modelling in understanding the dynamics of police-citizen interactions, highlighting the importance of procedural justice in establishing legitimacy and citizen cooperation. While adherence to procedures is essential, it is the way officers deliver them – fairly and respectfully – that most strongly shapes citizen responses. These insights could inform future training and practice, enabling officers to foster legitimacy and prevent escalation in day-to-day policing.
